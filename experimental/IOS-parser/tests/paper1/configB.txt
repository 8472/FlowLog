! need a way for traffic from ge2/1 and ge2/2 to get out to the larger network
! unfortunately giving them the SVI isn't enough: we also config a gateway via mininet
! with the IP address of the appropriate SVI. But the rest of the network is not routable
! from the SVI unless we (1) change the gateway to one of the SVIs on routerA or...
! What we do: go via L2 hop on one of the vlans to reach the gateway on A
! choice of A is arbitrary; could use 10.5.103.1 as well.
