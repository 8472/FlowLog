! modified from LISA '10 paper
! made IP ranges more readable; removed an interface; removed ACLs

interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip address 10.232.0.1 255.255.255.0
 ip policy route-map internet

interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 ip address 10.232.8.1 255.255.255.0

! source routing:
access-list 10 permit 10.100.0.0 0.0.255.255
access-list 10 permit 10.200.0.0 0.0.255.255
access-list 20 permit 20.100.0.0 0.0.255.255
access-list 20 permit 20.200.0.0 0.0.255.255

! TN: the ID "internet" has two map entries, which are checked in numeric order.
!     It just so happens that in this case, the ACL ids and the entry ids are the same.
! If no "match" was specified, then the map would apply to all packets.
!
route-map internet permit 10
match ip address 10
set ip next-hop 10.232.0.10
!
route-map internet permit 20
match ip address 20
set ip next-hop 10.232.0.20
!
end
