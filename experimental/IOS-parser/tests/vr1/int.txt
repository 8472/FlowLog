ip nat inside source list 1 interface in_dmz overload
!
! Project does not support in_dmz (which was the "next hop" before)
!
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.100.1.2

! Needs-nat is not limited to (or indeed, guaranteed to cover all of) the interface subnet.
! So here is a piece of the LAN (a /24 out of a /16) and another /24 that
! (in theory) comes via another L3 device:
access-list 1 permit 10.100.1.0 0.0.0.255
access-list 1 permit 10.100.2.0 0.0.0.255
! // need to give the end command
