/* Explanation of port number types:

   Because Exodus splits a router into multiple sub-switches with different notions of "port",
   different namespaces can get confusing.

   PHYSICAL PORTS: on the "host" side of the vlan sub-switch.
     These include switchport interfaces and normal interfaces that aren't virtual

   ROUTER PORTS: on the "host" side of the router sub-switch
     These include all interfaces visible from L3, including virtuals.
     The indices start with 2, because the

   ADJUSTED ROUTER PORTS: these are the "router" side ports on the vlan-subswitch.
     Same number as the router ports, but offset by the number of physical ports
     on the subswitch. (1...n = physical; n+1...n+m = adjusted router)

   The p2r relation holds each vlan's physical<--->adjusted router mapping.

   TODO: we also need a relation for vlan's physical<----> router mapping.
