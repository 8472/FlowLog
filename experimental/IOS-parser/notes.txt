Questions and concerns
----------------------

Do we need to keep a spanning tree per Vlan?

For tree-flood, do we need to send out host interfaces as well as those on the
spanning tree?

Will MAC learning on the Vlan switches avoid sending rtr -> physical packets
out ALL interfaces for the appropriate vlan?

Does a static routing command just add routes to the table (with next hop?)



subnets table may be too large for analysis
