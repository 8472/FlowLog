ip nat inside source list 1 interface in_dmz overload

! Project does not support in_dmz (which was the "next hop" before)

! TEST [not included in paper config]: make sure needs-nat gets all subnets that appear here.
! Needs-nat is not limited to (or indeed, guaranteed to cover all of) the interface subnet.
! So here is a piece of the LAN (a /24 out of a /16) and another /24 that
! (in theory) comes via another L3 device:
access-list 1 permit 192.168.1.1 0.0.0.255
access-list 1 permit 192.167.1.1 0.0.0.255
! // need to give the end command
