                  policy-neutral concept for enforcing access
                  control. Many extensions have been proposed, the most
                  significant of which are the decentralized
                  administration of role-based systems and the
                  enforcement of constraints. However, the simultaneous
                  integration of these extensions can cause con icts in
                  a later system implementation. We demonstrate how we
                  use the Alloy language for the speci cation of a con
                  ict-free rolebased system. This speci cation provides
                  us at the same time with a suitable basis for further
                  analysis by the Alloy constraint analyser.},

@book{jackson:alloybook,
  Abstract =     {{In <i>Software Abstractions</i> Daniel Jackson
                  introduces a new approach to software design that
                  draws on traditional formal methods but exploits
                  automated tools to find flaws as early as
                  possible. This approach--which Jackson calls
                  "lightweight formal methods" or "agile
                  modeling"--takes from formal specification the idea of
                  a precise and expressive notation based on a tiny core
                  of simple and robust concepts but replaces
                  conventional analysis based on theorem proving with a
                  fully automated analysis that gives designers
                  immediate feedback. Jackson has developed Alloy, a
                  language that captures the essence of software
                  abstractions simply and succinctly, using a minimal
                  toolkit of mathematical notions. The designer can use
                  automated analysis not only to correct errors but also
                  to make models that are more precise and elegant. This
                  approach, Jackson says, can rescue designers from "the
                  tarpit of implementation technologies" and return them
                  to thinking deeply about underlying concepts. <br />
                  <br /> <i>Software Abstractions</i> introduces the key
                  elements of the approach: a logic, which provides the
                  building blocks of the language; a language, which
                  adds a small amount of syntax to the logic for
                  structuring descriptions; and an analysis, a form of
                  constraint solving that offers both simulation
                  (generating sample states and executions) and checking
                  (finding counterexamples to claimed properties).  The
                  book uses Alloy as a vehicle because of its simplicity
                  and tool support, but the book's lessons are mostly
                  language-independent, and could also be applied in the
                  context of other modeling languages.}},
