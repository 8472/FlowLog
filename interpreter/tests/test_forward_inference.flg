/*
  Single rule to rewrite network source address field of an ip packet.
  Should (1) pass validation
  and    (2) actually perform the modification when tested with h1 ping h2.
  (3) When replacing ip_packet_in with packet_in, should not pass validation.

  (4) Moreover, this should be tested with -notables to
      confirm that fields are handled properly in XSB.
