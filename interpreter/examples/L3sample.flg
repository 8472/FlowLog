/*
 * Sample program which configures Layer 3 routing between two directly-
 * attached subnets. Forwarding within subnets is handled by MAC Learning.
 * A third, external subnet is also attached, representing "the internet".
 *
 * Note: "gw" is the abbreviation for "gateway"
 *
 *
 * The router is identified by DPID 0x1000000000000001
 *
 * The first subnet is 10.0.1.0/24 (gw 10.0.1.1), attached to port 1
 * The second is 10.0.2.0/24 (gw 10.0.2.1), attached to port 2
 *
 * Each subnet has a "translator switch" which represents the flow table
 * between the router and the root ("Layer 2") switch of the subnet. The
 * translator switch rewrites the destination MAC address using ARP.
