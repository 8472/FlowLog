Black Boxes and Events
----------------------


A black-box invocation can appear in the following ways:

(B1) as a *predicate* in the body of a rule: 
"if the black box returns true for <a, b, c>..."

(B2) as a *term* in the body of a rule:
"if t is a tuple in the black-box's result, and R(t)..."

(B3) as the result predicate in the head of a rule;
"if alpha is satisfied, send the following tuples to the black box."

An event can appear in the following ways:

(E1) in the head and body of a rule as the "trigger" for that
rule. This is identical to the way standalone FlowLog treats
packets.



Which do our examples use?

Fill in examples + detail.


(B1): Replace the BB reference with a nullary predicate p() in the
datalog translation. remember the original terms! at each packet
evaluation, invoke the black-box before passing to datalog and
assert(p()) if the BB returns true, retract(p()) otherwise. 

(B2): Replace R(bbt, ...) with BB(NewVar), R(NewVar, ...). Invoke the
black-box before passing to datalog for evaluation. Clear out the BB
relation, then assert the tuples returned by datalog. (Even if the R
is negated, this should be ok.)

(B3): This would be a new type of result predicate, beyond
emit/+R/-R. Just have to remember which names go to which BB callback,
and send as appropriate after evaluation.

(E1) ...
