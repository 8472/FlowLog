% TN: Running XSB to explore Flowlog interpretation.
% 

% Datalog has no notion of fields, so we need to widen the relations.
% But if we are using XSB, we have access to PROLOG...
% Want to ask, e.g. emit(orig_packet, X). and see what comes up for X.


%:- table emit/2.

% everything in head needs to be constrained (positively) in body.
% (so we will need to handle flooding specially)


   
% put negatives last in clause!
emit(P1, P2) :- r(P1),P1=P2.
emit(P1, P2) :- P1=P1,P2=P2.
emit(P1, P2) :- P1=5, P2=11, not(r(P2)).
emit(P1, P2) :- P1=5,P2=7.

r(5).
r(6).

   
   % a more complex version of this query asks for all new packets
   % that should be emitted for arrival packet 5.
      
   emit(5, X).
